1.) Time Series Prediction using DA-RNN and Transformers: 

Paper-1 : DA-RNN https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02971
Paper-2 : Transformer https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

Baseline Code : https://github.com/KurochkinAlexey/DA-RNN

My modifications : I did several modifications to the baseline architecture, which are:
a.) 
b.)
c.)

Results:


Conclusions: 



2.) Fast Transformers for next level character prediction: All the following architectures were implemented from scratch in Tensorflow: 

a.) Linformer
b.) Fast Autoregressive Transformer
c.) Sparse Transformer
